🩺 MediSync: Health Data Information and Management System

MediSync is a web-based health information management system designed to store, organize, and monitor patient health records digitally. The project aims to simplify how medical data is handled by replacing traditional paper-based systems with a secure and user-friendly online platform.

This system allows patients to register, update their medical information, and access their reports conveniently. Doctors can log in, view patient details, and provide medical suggestions or updates in real time. MediSync ensures data accuracy, privacy, and easy accessibility for both patients and healthcare professionals.
